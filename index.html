                            Natural language processing (NLP) has evolved as a promising field for helping users explore and interact with data for visual analysis tasks. The applications of NLP for supporting various aspects of the visual analysis workflow include: understanding the interplay between text and charts to help readers take away key information from the chart or dashboard, supporting interaction modalities to help people naturally ``ask" questions of their data, and exploring ways to enrich the semantics of data, among others. As data-driven communication is more important than ever, how do we treat text and language as first-class citizens in helping people see and understand data? How do we couple language and charts to make the data more accessible to a variety of audiences with different needs, capabilities, and skills? As the field of NLP matures, computers now have an increased capability of interpreting language and engaging in conversations with people. But can NLP techniques and interactive visualizations work in concert to support an analytical conversation? As the platforms and channels for exploring data go beyond the desktop to chat interfaces, mobile, and large displays, how do we better understand user intent, modalities, and context to make these interactions more meaningful?

                        <p>
                            Addressing these questions calls for research at the intersection of human-computer interaction, information visualization, and NLP, three fields with natural connections (pun intended) but rather infrequent meetings.
                            This workshop will assemble an interdisciplinary community that promotes collaboration across these fields, explore research opportunities and challenges, and establish an agenda for NLP research specifically for data visualization.

                    As natural language techniques span various aspects of the visual analysis workflow, the
                    field of information visualization needs to consider the challenges and research opportunities that NLP presents as it continues to grow in relevance. This workshop will be dedicated to the
                    identification, organization, and discussion of those topics and the development of a research community centered around them.
